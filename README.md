# üß™ Team API Project ‚Äì LL13

Let‚Äôs build something fun together in LiveLab 13 ‚Äî no pressure, just practice!

In this mini project, you‚Äôll build a small interactive webpage that fetches data from a public API and displays it using JavaScript.

## üóÇ Included Files
- `index.html` ‚Äî your base HTML structure
- `script.js` ‚Äî your JavaScript logic (with Copilot helper comments at the top)
- `style.css` ‚Äî optional styles (empty file included)
- `.devcontainer/` ‚Äî pre-configured environment for Codespaces (includes Live Preview + Copilot)

## ü§ñ Suggested AI Prompt
> How can I fetch data from the [API name] and display it on a simple webpage using vanilla JavaScript?

## ‚úÖ Your Team's Mission
Use one of the Easy APIs provided to:
1. Prompt AI to scaffold your `fetch()` logic
2. Parse the JSON response
3. Display it on the webpage using the DOM

Collaborate using Live Share if needed ‚Äî and remember, the goal is **learning through doing**, not perfection.

## ‚è± Time Reminder
You have **30 minutes** total. Use the first 5 minutes to choose your API and divide up roles.

Happy coding!
