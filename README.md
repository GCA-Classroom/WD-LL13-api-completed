# ✅ LL13 Completed Project – API Team Activity

This repo contains a completed solution for LiveLab 13 in the GCA Web Development track.

Students were tasked with collaborating in teams to build a simple webpage using JavaScript’s `fetch()` method and a public API.

## 📦 Included Files
- `index.html` – base HTML structure
- `script.js` – completed JavaScript logic using YesNo.WTF API
- `style.css` – lightweight styling for visual clarity
- `.devcontainer/` – pre-configured environment for Codespaces

## 🧠 Key Concepts Reinforced
- Using `fetch()` to make GET requests to APIs
- Parsing JSON responses
- Dynamically updating the DOM
- Prompting AI to scaffold beginner-friendly code

## ⚠️ Note
This repo is intended for instructor use and demo reference. Students use the [starter repo](https://github.com/GCA-Classroom/WD-LL13-api-starter) to build their own version.
